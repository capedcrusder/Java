There are two types of Data Types-:

1)Primitive Data Types :-

                       a) Integer(byte, short, int, long)
                              (i) byte -> stores small value
                                       -> size of byte is 8 bit i.e 1 bytes

                                       Eg :- byte b = 1;

                              (ii) short -> stores values larger than byte & smaller than int
                                         -> size of short is 16 bit i.e 2 bytes

                                         Eg :- short s = 12;

                              (iii)  int -> stores smaller numbers
                                         -> size of int is 32 bit i.e 4 bytes

                                         Eg :- 234;

                              (iv)  long -> stores larger values
                                         -> sive is 64 bit i.e 8 bytes

                                         Eg :- long l=1234567;

                       b) Float(float,double)
                                             -> by deafult in java the compiler always takes decimal values as double becausefloat has limited precision value
                                             -> user have to explicitly mention that he is entering float value
                                              
                                              Eg -: float f = 3.14f 
                                                    double d = 3.142345; 



                       c) char :-
                                  can hold num as well as alphabet

                                  Eg :- 
                                  char a ='4';
                                  char b = 'f';


                       d) boolean(true/false) :- 
                                              -> always gives the value true/false as output
