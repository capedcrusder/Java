Type Conversion :
              -> converting a value from one datatype to another datatype

There are two type of Conversions
1) Implicit Conversion :- 
                    -> When the compiler converts one data type into another by itself it is called implicit conversion
                    -> also called as Widening Conversion   
         
       byte->short->int->long->float->double  

2) Explicit Conversion :- 
                     -> When the user has to mention in the code to cast one data type into another it is called as Explicit Conversion. 
                     -> also called as casting/Narrowing             


 NOTE:-
      Smaller size data types can be converted into larger size data types implicitly as they can hold small values
