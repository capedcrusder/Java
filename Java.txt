-> released in 1995;
-> platform independent language unlike C/C++(before java if there are two platforms the code executable on platform 1 is not executable at platform 2)
-> With the introduction of Java the code executable at platform 1 will be executable at platform 2 due to JVM;

JVM(Java Virtual Machine) :
                       ->macine specific software i.e responsible for running bytecode on platform
                       ->JVM convert java program into bytecode which can run on any platform which have JVM.
                       ->JVM is pre-installed on machines that's java is called as machine independent.
                       ->JVM is platform dependent, it requires OS to run.


PROPERTIES : 
            1) Statically Typed :- Have to declare every variable that is used unlike python/javascript.
                                :-memory is alloted at the compile time.

            2) Secure :- JVM ensures no bytecode runs without monitoring(As java doesn't have pointers so there is no way to access memory)

            3) Simple
            4) Popular


 INSTALLING JAVA :
                 ->  Download JDK(Java Development Kit)
                 -> JDK comprises of JVM[JRE], Compiler & Development Tools

IDE : VS CODE, Eclipse, IntelliJ
